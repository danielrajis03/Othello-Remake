Game Rules
The rules of Othello are simple yet strategically complex:

The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
Each player has discs of a distinct color, traditionally black and white.
Players take turns placing discs on the board with their color facing up.
A player must place their disc such that it surrounds at least one of the opponent's discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Surrounded opponent discs are flipped to the current player's color.
If a player cannot make a valid move, their turn is skipped.
The game ends when neither player can make a valid move.
The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins.

Features:

Classic Othello gameplay with a user-friendly interface.
Functional AI opponent.
Real-time board visualization.
Option to play against a friend or the AI.
