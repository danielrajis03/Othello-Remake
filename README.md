Game Rules
The rules of Othello are simple yet strategically complex:

The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
Each player has discs of a distinct color, traditionally black and white.
Players take turns placing discs on the board with their color facing up.
A player must place their disc such that it surrounds at least one of the opponent's discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Surrounded opponent discs are flipped to the current player's color.
If a player cannot make a valid move, their turn is skipped.
The game ends when neither player can make a valid move.
The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins.

Features:

Classic Othello gameplay with a user-friendly interface.
Functional AI opponent.
Real-time board visualization.


Getting Started:
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

Usage:

Start the game by running the main class.
You will be loaded into an on-screen game against the AI.
The game will continue until it ends due to no valid moves or the board is full.

AI Strategy:

The AI opponent employs a basic strategy for making moves. 
It tries to maximize its disc count while minimizing the opponent's potential gains. 
The AI evaluates potential moves based on factors like corner and edge positions, mobility, and disc parity.

Have fun playing Othello and testing your strategic skills against the AI opponent! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
